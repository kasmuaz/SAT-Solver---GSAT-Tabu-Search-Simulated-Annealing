This was done as a project in graduate course Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures.
In this project I implemented three metaheuristcs and tested them against various inputs. 
Results are shown in documentation. In documentation it is explained what is SAT problem and
why it is hard. There is description of mechanism of reading boolean formula from file.  
Also there is pretty detailed discussion of implemented metaheuristics followed
by pseudocode.
